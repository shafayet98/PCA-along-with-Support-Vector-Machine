# Support Vector Machine Implementation along with Principal Component Analysis

# PCA
In this particular project I used PCA to reduce the dimentionality of the dataset.
As the data set has 13 or so features it's hard to visualize the as a whole.
So i used PCA to reduce the dimension from 13 to 2, so that it can be visualized properly.
After that I recoverd the data.

# SVM
Support vector machines was used to predict the presence of the heart disease from the dataset i used from Kaggle.
